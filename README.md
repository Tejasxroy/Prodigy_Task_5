# 🚗 US Accident Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Overview  
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **US Accident Dataset** sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to extract insights into accident trends across different states, weather conditions, time of occurrence, and other contributing factors.  

The dataset contains information on accidents recorded in the United States, helping to analyze key accident patterns and their causes.
