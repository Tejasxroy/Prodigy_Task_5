# 🚗 US Accident Data Analysis - EDA & Accident Severity Prediction

## 📌 Overview  
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **US Accident Dataset** sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to extract insights into accident trends across different states, weather conditions, time of occurrence, and Built a Machine Learning model to predict accident severity based on weather, road conditions, and time of occurrence. 

The dataset contains information on accidents recorded in the United States, helping to analyze key accident patterns and their causes.

## 📊 Key Insights  
✔ **Accident Trends** - Identifies peak accident times (rush hours, weekends, weather conditions).  
✔ **Severity Analysis** - Determines factors contributing to severe accidents.  
✔ **Geographical Analysis** - Maps accident hotspots in the U.S.  
✔ **Weather Impact** - Analyzes how rain, fog, and temperature influence accidents.  

✔ **Identified high-risk accident zones and peak accident hours.**

✔ **Explored impact of weather and road conditions on accident severity.**

✔ **Built an ML model with 80% accuracy to predict accident severity levels.**
